It's not well supported for framework like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and the next generation version of AngularJS which is know as Angular 2\r\n\r\n###Ok! But I need a wrapper for Angular 1.x.\r\nThat's already available [here](https://github.com/jadjoubran/angular-material-design-lite). Angular 2 version of the wrapper is basically base on this angular 1.x version. So, special thanks to [Jad Joubran](https://github.com/jadjoubran).\r\n\r\n###Where can I find the documentation?\r\n[Click here](https://sabbirrahman.github.io/ng2-mdl)\r\n\r\n###Want to Contribute?\r\nThis library is at very early age. So any contribution like a new component, bug fixes etc is cordially welcome. :)",
